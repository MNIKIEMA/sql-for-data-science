# SQL Training Companion Repository

This repository serves as a companion to the SQL and PostgreSQL course I undertook on Udemy. It's a personal compilation of notes, queries, and scripts I've created while learning. It's designed to help me reinforce the concepts and share my learning journey with others interested in SQL.

## What's Inside

- **SQL Queries**: A collection of SQL queries and solutions to exercises presented in the course.
- **PostgreSQL Exercises**: Practical PostgreSQL exercises that complement the course materials.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: A collection of Jupyter notebooks demonstrating how to use SQL.

## How to Navigate This Repository

- The `query.md` file contains queries and their solutions to exercises in the course.
- In the `project-queries.sql` file, you will find queries that are used in the project.
- Notebooks demonstrating SQL concepts can be found under the `section-12-project.ipynb` file.
- The `datasets` directory contains files in different format: `.csv, .tar, .db`.
